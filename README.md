# RegionalCrimeAnalysis

Overview:

This project aims to expand upon an existing two-force crime analysis by incorporating a third-party dataset. By doing so, we will be able to explore crime trends at a regional level and investigate potential correlations with other factors. Additionally, the feasibility of a postcode-level analysis to link crimes to properties on the market will be explored.


Key Features:

Data Pipeline: A well-structured and readable pipeline that combines existing and new datasets, ensuring data quality and reproducibility.
Data Layers: Clear separation of data handling and processing logic for better maintainability.
Unit Testing: Comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness and robustness of the pipeline.
Version Control: Use of a version control system (e.g., GitHub) to track changes and collaborate effectively.


Requirements:

Third-Party Dataset: Integration of a relevant external dataset to enrich the analysis.
Pipeline Best Practices: Adherence to coding best practices, including data layers, logging, and unit testing.
GitHub Repository: Storage of all project code, including the pipeline, unit tests, and documentation.


Deliverables:

A GitHub repository containing:
The structured pipeline code.
Unit tests for the pipeline.
Documentation explaining the project's objectives, methodology, and results.
Marking Scheme:

The project will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of the pipeline, the quality of the unit tests, and the overall adherence to best practices.


Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone <repository_url>
Use code with caution.

Set Up Environment: Install the required Python libraries using a virtual environment or package manager.
Run the Pipeline: Execute the main pipeline script to process the data and generate the desired outputs.
Run Unit Tests: Run the unit test suite to verify the correctness of the pipeline's components.
Additional Notes:

The specific details of the third-party dataset and the submission date will be provided by the training team.
